 <h2>Using Dota 2 Sound Editor</h2>
 The Dota 2 Sound editor allows you to modify sounds for hero spells, items and music. 
 To begin, select a tab from the top of the window. Then, if applicable, select an entry from the dropdown box and 
 expand the list of sounds associated with a particular action. From there, you can view each sound for a hero spell,
 item or musical trigger. For each sound, you can:<br><br>
 
 <b>Replace</b><br>
 This allows you to change what sound plays when the selected action is performed.<br><br>
 
 <b>Revert</b><br>
 This restores the selected action to its default sound.<br><br>
 
 <b>Revert All</b><br>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Hero Spells:</b> This restores all actions for to current hero to their default sounds.</li><br>
 <li><b>Items:</b>  This restores all item actions to their default sound.</li></b>
 <li><b>Music:</b> This restores all music for the current category to its default song.</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 <b>Advanced/Basic</b><br>
 The Advanced button allows you to view the current hero's entire sound script as a tree. Currently, manual editing is 
 not supported, but will be added in the future.<br>
 While in Advanced mode, Replace, Revert and Play Sound will only work on nodes that contain a path to a sound file.<br>
 Clicking the <b>Basic</b> button will return the editor to Basic mode.

 <h1>Found a bug?</h1>
 Please let me know. When the program crashes, it attempts to generate an error.txt. Attaching these 
 files to an email, and giving a detailed description of what you were doing when the program crashed 
 both help a lot in determining the cause of a bug or crash. Thanks!
