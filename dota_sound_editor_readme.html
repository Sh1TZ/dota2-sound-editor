 <h2>Using Dota 2 Sound Editor</h2>
 The Dota 2 Sound editor allows you to modify the sounds that are played when heroes in Dota 2 perform actions.
  To begin, select a hero from the dropdown box. Then, expand the list of sounds associated with a particular action. 
 From there, you can view each sound that may occur when a hero performs that action. For each sound, you can:<br><br>
 
 <b>Replace</b><br>
 This allows you to change what sound plays when the selected action is performed.<br><br>
 
 <b>Revert</b><br>
 This restores the selected action to its default sound.<br><br>
 
 <b>Revert All</b><br>
 This restores all actions for to current hero to their default sounds.<br><br>
 <b>Advanced/Basic</b><br>
 The Advanced button allows you to view the current hero's entire sound script as a tree. Triple-click any node to allow manual editing.<br>
 While in Advanced mode, Replace, Revert and Play Sound will only work on nodes that contain a path to a sound file.<br>
 Clicking the <b>Basic</b> button will return the editor to Basic mode.

 <h1>Found a bug?</h1>
 Please let me know. When the program crashes, it attempts to generate two text files: stackTrace.txt, and error.txt. Attaching these files to an email, and giving a detailed description of what you were doing when the program crashed both help a lot in determining the cause of a bug or crash. Thanks!
